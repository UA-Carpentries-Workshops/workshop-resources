## Setting up 2-FA on Github

2-FA, aka 2-factor authentication, will secure your account to prevent hackers gaining access to it. This is similar to how NetID + (Duo Mobile) works.

[How to setup 2-FA on Github](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-two-factor-authentication/)

You can use Duo Mobile to setup 2-FA with Github.

Once you have that configured you will not be able to use your password to push to your Github repository. Instead of your password you need to setup a `Personal access token` under `Developer Settings` and use that.

## Using SSH

Using SSH can be more secure.

## Using visual git tools

There is a variety of visual tools that make it easier to use git. These tools will do all of the most common git commands and more.

I like [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) best but some other popular tools are:

* [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Git Kraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/)
