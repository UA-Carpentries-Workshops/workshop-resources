This is my personal Software Carpenty repo where I keep source files used in the workshops and Jupyter Notebooks.

I am co-teaching the Python for the first time at the next Software Carpentry.

The Python lesson include a Jupyter Notebook.  We use Anaconda3 in the workshops. Steps to use:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install Anaconda3
3. Open a terminal or command prompt.  On Windows I highly recommend ConEmu
4. Start Anaconda3 witht he command -- conda
5. Navigate to the Jupyter Notebook in python lessons/Fundamentals
6. Start the notebook with the command -- jupyter notebook

Enjoy.
